# Workshop Pre-Read

Hi everyone,

I wanted to update this invite to include a small pre-read. Please let me know if you have any questions. I use the term ‘sprint’ throughout the documentation and activities. I realize that we are doing a modified ‘design sprint’ but I wanted to stay consistent with the overall philosophy.

**📜** **The guiding principles**

* **Getting started is more important than being 100% right.** The Sprint is here to help us adopt a versatile think→prototype→test→learn mindset. This allows us to be agile problem solvers and make better decisions faster.
* **Learning in the real world consolidates desk research.** À la the Lean Startup approach, we want to validate our ideas with real people really fast.
* **Tangible results are better than endless discussions.** You'll see the Sprint is really intense and there are no empty conversations. Every time we will talk, comment or discuss, we'll be looking AT something \(a sketch, a prototype, an example\).
* **You don't need to be an artist.** Although it's called a **Design** Sprint, you don't need to be an interface design expert. The process allows anyone with any role to come up with great ideas.

**🎯** **The task**

**We want to explore ideas for improving the online customer experience by exploring a new 10X toolkit, because:**

* We noticed our customers our leaving our product really quickly after signing up
* Research shows people don't understand what we do and how we're different
* It will take much longer to build a homegrown tool rather than purchase something that allows us to work ‘out of the box’
* Research suggests there are 5 themes customers would like us to tackle, leveraging this toolkit would allow us to work smarter not harder

**⭐️** **The expectations**

By the end of our Design Sprint, we expect the following outcomes:

* Have a better, more complete understanding of the challenges we face when it comes to customers interacting with a new 10X website
* Have generated a set of potential solutions to improve the experience
* Have created a customer-facing, high-fidelity prototype
* Have tested out the prototype with \(at least\) 5 real customers & collected feedback
* Have a clear answer whether our solutions is viable + next steps

**📍Where**

As a remote team, we need a virtual meeting room. We will be using [**Miro**](https://miro.com/) throughout the entire Sprint. We will collect all our thoughts and resources there, as well as run all the exercises.

You have all been invited to join the "Springboard" Miro board. If you haven't received the invite, please reach out immediately.

Please make sure to watch these 2 onboarding videos of Miro \(it takes 5 mins\):

**🏁** **Final remarks**

Yay, you've made it all the way to the end! You're now prepared for our upcoming Design Sprint. Rest assured, you will have guidance along the way — if you have any questions or concerns, please reach out to me.
