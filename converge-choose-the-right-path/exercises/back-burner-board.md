# Back Burner Board

**Supplies needed:** Whiteboard, Markers

**Estimated time:** 30min for review

## Best to use when

A lot of ideas will be generated throughout the week. Some of the ideas will be pertinent to the tasks at hand, but others, although interesting, wonâ€™t be. Capture these good but not immediately relevant back burner ideas on a sticky note board.

## Instructions

1. Have a dedicated space to collect back burner ideas on the whiteboard.
2. Throughout the sprint have everyone write down ideas that are not directly

   solving the job-to-be-done

   and put them up on the whiteboard.

3. As a team during the converge phase,

   review all the ideas that have been put

   up on the wall.

   Trash any that aren't relevant anymore.

4. Record all ideas in a separate document or Trello.
