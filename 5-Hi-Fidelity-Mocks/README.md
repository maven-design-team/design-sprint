# Hi-Fidelity Mocks: Drill down the details

The core purpose of the hi-fidelity mock, the assumptions you are trying to
validate/invalidate or the knowledge gaps you are trying to fill should have all
been discussed in [Converge](../3-Converge) and details sussed out in [Prototype](../4-Prototype). During this phase you will build a
more details and highly designed mocks that can be shared with high level stakeholders. 

The high-fidelity wireframe at messy.studio includes more actual content, specific typeface choices, and may include specific information on image dimensions, and even button styles. We tend to play with shades of grey rather than sticking to sheer black and white in order to lay out subtleties in contrast that will appear once color is applied, style the navigation, and really look at pairing typefaces in a space where color is not a conflicting option. In this case, our designers start to see the life of the site emerge before color and imagery are even an option. This step for us at messy.studio moves the wireframe a little beyond the basic structural benefits, moving toward the life-like qualities of design, but without distracting from the focus of function.
